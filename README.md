# QGIS-StreamDeck
This project aims to create Profiles with the main QGIS functions for Stream Deck.
The first version will be published in a few days.

Personally, I have used StreamDeck in other than to online meetings and OBS Studio, also in Geographic Information Systems such as ArcGIS Pro and QGIS.
I could not find any explicit online reference to this usage and thus decided to share some usage profiles in QGIS.
